# MyDashboard

This repository contains a simple React dashboard served with Vite.

Use `./start.sh` on Unix-like systems or `start.ps1` or `start.bat` on Windows to run the development server. These scripts print the local network IP address before launching Vite so you can access the dashboard from other devices on the same network.
